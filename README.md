# PyLoL - League of Legends v4.20 Learning Environment
PyLoL is the Python component of the League of Legends v4.20 Learning Environment (using a modified version of the LeagueSandbox's GameServer project, not the original server from Riot). It exposes a custom machine learning API for the GameServer project as a Python RL Environment. PyLoL provides an interface for RL agents to interact with the League of Legends v4.20, getting observations and sending actions.
