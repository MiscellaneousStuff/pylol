# PyLoL - League of Legends v4.20 Learning Environment
PyLoL is the Python component of the League of Legends v4.20 Learning Environment (using a modified version of the LeagueSandbox's GameServer project, not the original server from Riot). It exposes a custom machine learning API for the GameServer project as a Python RL Environment. PyLoL provides an interface for RL agents to interact with the League of Legends v4.20, getting observations and sending actions.

# Quick Start Guide

## Google Colab

The easiest way to try pylol at the moment is to visit this Google Colab:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/MiscellaneousStuff/pylol/blob/colab/League_of_Legends_v4_20_Deep_Reinforcement_Learning_Agent.ipynb)

It doesn't do much at the moment apart from to demonstrate that everything
loads from this repository properly and that the GameServer works without
any human clients connected to it. The implementation has only been properly
tested for a single agent playing at the moment but will be changed very
soon.
